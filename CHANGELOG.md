# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- Leon Becker, the current maintainer, is now listed first in the app metadata
  with a contact address. Daniel Thwaites, the original author, is listed
  second. Agreed in #264.

### Translations
- Updated translations from Transifex (da, en_GB, fr, ga, lb, sk, sv, tr, uk,
  zh_HK).

### Dependencies
- Bundled libraries refreshed within their existing ranges: axios 1.16.0 to
  1.20.0, dompurify 3.4.11 to 3.4.14, fast-xml-parser 5.7.3 to 5.11.1,
  brace-expansion 2.1.0 to 2.1.4 (#269, not reachable from the shipped code).
- @nextcloud/vite-config 1.7.2 to 2.5.4. Build tooling only, the bundle is
  unchanged apart from license headers now being emitted per chunk.
- The frontend is now built with Node 24. Node 20 is end of life.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- URLs containing credentials (https://user:password@host/...) no longer expose
  them in activity events or on the settings page. The download still uses them,
  the displayed URL does not.

### Changed
- The success message reads "The file has been transferred." instead of
  "transferred successfully", per the Nextcloud wording guidelines.

### Translations
- Updated translations from Transifex. The strings added in 1.0.0 are now
  translated in a range of locales.

### Dependencies
- vite 7.3.5 to 7.3.6
- @nextcloud/axios 2.5.1 to 2.6.0
- @nextcloud/files 3.8.0 to 3.12.2
- @nextcloud/l10n 3.1.0 to 3.4.1
- @nextcloud/router 3.0.1 to 3.1.0
- @nextcloud/browserslist-config 3.0.1 to 3.1.2

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

First stable release. The core functionality is stable and the app is now in
maintenance mode. Going forward the focus is bug fixes, keeping up with new
Nextcloud releases, and occasionally adding a feature. The 0.7.x line was the
initial re-release after the project changed hands, covering a full frontend
rewrite, a build-system migration, and a dependency cleanup. This release adds
live progress, immediate transfers, and a settings page, which rounds out the
feature set for 1.0.

### Added
- Personal settings page (Settings > Transfer) showing active transfers with
  live progress bars, filenames, URLs, and cancel buttons. It polls every 3
  seconds and pauses while the tab is hidden.
- Immediate transfer option. A checkbox in the dialog starts a transfer right
  away instead of waiting for the next cron cycle. Closing the tab stops the
  heartbeat, which cancels the server-side transfer within 10 seconds.
- Progress tracking and cancellation via Nextcloud's distributed cache. Each
  transfer reports progress through `CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION`, and a cancel
  flag aborts the download. This requires Redis or Memcached. The background
  queue still works without it.

### Changed
- Nextcloud 34 is now supported. The compatibility range is 29 to 34.
- Hardened `TransferService`: per-transfer IDs, stall detection that aborts a
  transfer after 120 seconds without data, consolidated exception handling
  that always cleans up the temp file, and a retry loop for concurrent writes of
  the same filename.

### Fixed
- Checksums pasted in uppercase no longer fail verification. The comparison is
  case-insensitive and constant-time now.
- Toasts no longer rely on the deprecated OC.Notification API, which newer
  Nextcloud versions have removed. A failed immediate transfer used to leave
  the dialog stuck on "Starting" because of this.
- Cancelling an immediate transfer, from the dialog or from the settings page,
  returns the dialog to the form with all fields kept instead of closing it.
- The success activity event showed as malformed on Nextcloud 34, which
  requires rich object ids to be strings.
- A hostname that does not resolve is reported as unreachable instead of
  claiming the URL is blocked by security settings.
- A failing download no longer produces a 500 on the Nextcloud server. The
  remote site returning an error is a normal outcome: the start endpoint now
  reports what happened (remote status code, unreachable host, blocked URL,
  checksum mismatch) and the dialog shows a matching message.

### Dependencies
- dompurify 3.4.2 to 3.4.11
- qs 6.15.1 to 6.15.2
- vite 7.3.3 to 7.3.5

### Translations
- Updated translations from Transifex.
